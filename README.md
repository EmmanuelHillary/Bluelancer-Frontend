After successfully forking and cloning the repository, you now need to add the files you just created.</br>
In other for the repository to be easily accessible by others, we have decided that each contribution should be in </br>
form of a folder and the name of the folder should be a brief description of what you worked on e.g landing_page, <br/> navigation_bar, footer_section etc. <br/>
Inside the folder you created, you should then add the files (HTML and/or CSS) for the part you worked on.</br>
